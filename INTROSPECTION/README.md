```
I can be choosed into the club for several resons....few of them are,
1. I have a good interpersonal skill so i can interact with anyone easily and work with them.
2. Given a team work I would like to lead them with the skills I have and make sure each one contributes relevant information and work accordingly, in a given instance if there comes a hardship my first job is to explain the reason to the hardship and ask the team as a whole to come out of that, since Hardships caused in teams are everyone's fault.
3. I practice generosity hence it'll be easy for me to understand people around me soon interacted with.
4. I usually teach people the concepts they feel hard with hence helping them and sharing my knowledge with others, since we only learn all time to share either the results or the path or the methods with others.
5. Also I see this opportunity as a way to contribute to an exciting/forward-thinking club, and I feel I can contribute my atmost ideas to this club.
6. I feel my skills are particularly well-suited for this club because it involves problem-solving, interactive thinking, rise of immediate thoughts to solve a given particular problem and find the easiest methodology to solve it...and, I believe I have the above mentioned  type of knowledge to succeed in this club â€¦

I WOULD HELP THE CLUB TO BE MORE CREATIVE, INTERACTIVE AND MAKE PEOPLE SHARE THEIR MOST SUPRISING INSTANCES ENCOUNTERED WITH TECHNOLOGY AT TIMES SO THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PERRS IS ALIVE ALL TIME.

I WOULD CONTRIBUTE MY SOLUTIONS TO THE STRUGGLES I'VE ENTOUNTERED WHILE WORKING WITH A CERTAIN TASK/CODE.etc TO THE CLUB SO THAT NONE IN THE CLUB FEEL DEVASTATED WHILE ENCOUNTERING THE SAME
